# 自动重定位脚本的配置文件

# 1. 地图设置
# Pre-processed PCD map file path (absolute path)
map_pcd_path: "/home/unitree/HongTu/G1Nav2D/src/fastlio2/PCD/platform_1_2.pcd" # <-- 修改这里：请填写您的地图文件的绝对路径

# 2. 初始位置估计
# The approximate starting position of the robot.
# We assume this is a fixed starting point, e.g., a charging station.
initial_pose:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0

# 3. 自动朝向搜索参数
# The script will search for the correct yaw angle automatically.
yaw_search:
  # The range of angles to search, in degrees.
  # For example, a range of 180 means searching from -180 to +180 degrees.
  range_deg: 180
  
  # The step size for the search, in degrees.
  # A smaller step increases accuracy but takes more time.
  # 15-30 degrees is a reasonable starting point.
  step_deg: 20
